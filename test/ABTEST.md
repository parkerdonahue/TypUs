## A/B Test Name: Customize Content Displayed 
User Story Number: User Story 6
- Metric (from the HEART grid): Engagement
- Hypothesis:
  - The problem we are trying to solve is whether or not users are engaged with the current display settings as they are not optimal for their reading preferences. As a group we came to the conclusion if it's not optimally readable they will not interact with our application. This will lead to less engagement, satisfaction, and the time they will spend on the app in which as a group we want to increase all three. By adding the ability to change options that are font related, we can improve user engagement, satisfation and the time spent using the app. 
- Experiment:
  - Since we are just starting, we can publish what we currently have to half the people that have answered in our survey. We can then count the number of times the user clicked to change the font size and let the other half have the default version. Using firebase analytics, we would need to keep track of how many times the font size setting is changed and the time spent on the app.
- Variation:
  - One variable I’d like to test is the ability to change font size because if the prompt and user input textbox is bigger, users will be more focused because the readability is clearer therefore making them more engaged and focused.

## A/B Test Name: Growing userbase through friend to friend adding
User Story Number: US 8
- Metric (from the HEART grid): Adoption
- Hypothesis:
	- The problem we are trying to solve is increasing and retaining the size of our user base, and its impact is the amount of analytics we have access to as we need the most possible information to satisfy users and boost user retention. The method for increasing userbase size we will implement is an easily accessible friend adding system. Users will be incentivized to add users to our app in order to gain access to their friends’ score on the leaderboard as users may have less fun without context for their scores. One variable I’d like to A/B test is the specific adding a friend process, one option is having a user button present at all times to be opened and view all about your profile, including a friend list to add friends. An alternative would be a social tab away from the profile tab that is designated for friends. 

- Experiment:
	- Before the friend system is implemented, we can offer accounts that not given the leaderboard option and the app remains solo. Once implemented, we can give half of the users the options to either keep their scores private or to post them to the leaderboard screen of the app where all friends can view their score. I am interested to see how private/public users engage with the app differently. 

- Variation:
	- The variable I feel should be tested is the ability to add friends and have a public account vs private or being forced to have a public account. How many people would choose public? Would this effect their retention and time spent using the app.
