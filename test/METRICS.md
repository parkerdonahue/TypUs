- User count
  - By using Google Analytics, we can observe the metrics to determine if the playerbase is enjoying the game. Google Analytics makes it easy to track the number of users as it is one of the default settings to be tracked. If many people are using the app, then the only logical conclusion is that people consider the app a decent way to spend their time and that they are having fun.
- Daily prompt completion rate
  - By using Google Analytics, we can start capturing the metrics for engagement. First, we start by tracking button clicks for when users click on the freeplay button or the sign up buttons. By doing so we can compare the number of the names on the leaderboard that will be created in the app in the near future. We can then compare using the leaderboard to the amount of signed up users.
- Friends list size
  - By observing the size of a user's friend list by checking through the Firebase backend data, we can determine how connected a person is when it comes to sharing the game with others. When a friend shares the game with another, they will likely friend each other to see each other's data, so the more friends that a user has, the more interconnected the playerbase is and proof there is of the game being adopted.
