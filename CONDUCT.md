## CSC305 Typus Group Code Of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as a group pledge to make
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

All members must act and interact in ways that contribute to an
open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Members of the Typus development team should think about their thoughts and then should express any ideas or concerns. All opinions are considered and will follow a consensus model. If the group can’t come to an agreement, then a majority vote will take place instead.

All members participating in the Typus Project must attend planned meetings that are agreed on in class or during other meetings. If for any reason you are unable to attend a meeting, let the group members know ahead of time and the reasoning for missing. If you have to miss the meeting, it has to be reasonable such as being sick, family priority, appointments, etc. Not wanting to be there shouldn’t be an excuse as we are all here to complete a project and get a good grade. If you had a reasonable excuse and couldn’t make it, we can catch up with your progress on discord or also reschedule to meet online instead.

Assignments will be made during meetings in order to efficiently divide work between members and prevent overlapping tasks. It is expected that assignments be completed to sufficient standards on an agreed upon timeline. Those who fail to meet these expectations will be consulted to determine the cause and it will be acted upon accordingly. Consistent failure to meet these expectations will lead to intervention between the offending member, other members, and the CTO in order to resolve the problem at the root. 

Participation in the group is mandatory. Everyone has a role to fulfill in order to get a good grade. Everyone should understand that not participating, contributing, communicating is not helpful to anyone and if need be there will be a designated facilitator if agreed upon in order to get work done. In order to honor members' strengths and interests, we will have a discussion at our designated meeting time in order to ensure that all voices of members are heard and to make sure that everyone has a say in the direction of how we want to proceed with the project.

Group Meetings will take place on Monday after the end of the project section in the URI Library as discussed by all members of Typus. Any notes that need to be taken during the meeting will be shared through a document which all members will have access to. All members may take notes and contribute their ideas.

All members of Typus should be prompt and be ready to discuss at the group meetings. If a member is late or missing, notify the group members ahead of time and provide the reason as to why you are missing as stated earlier in the Code of Conduct. All members should be present though because we are all in the same Project section.
To encourage and reinforce active listening, all voices of members are heard during the discussion meeting and are free to express their opinions. When speaking with each other, we should respect each other and refrain from using slurs, or any kind of improper language.

## Enforcement

behavior may be reported to Calvin, Christian or Vic. All complaints will

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
security of the reporter of any incident.

# Feedback

Feedback should be given during the meeting time, or be expressed in the discord group chat also. If you believe there is a better way to approach things than a group member is doing, feel free to express it. All group members should validate other’s opinions and communicate with each other to bring out the best product.
